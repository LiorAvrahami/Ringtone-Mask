# Ringtone-Mask!
apply simple mask to ringtone / alarm.

the mask is zero for some time (default 1 second), and then linearly increasing for some time (default 23 seconds)

the reason for silent start is that phones vibrates when ringing, thus you are likely to notice your phone ring even if the ringtone is silent.

the point of the linearly increasing ringtone is that the longer it takes you to answer, the more likely you are to be in a noisy enviroment that requires a louder ringtone.
